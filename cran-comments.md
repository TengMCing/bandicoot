## Note

* This is a resubmission of the package.
* For this resubmission, I have followed the reviewer's comment to enclose package names, software names, and API names in single quotes within the title and description, and have updated them accordingly.
* Unfortunately, there is no published paper yet describing the methods implemented in this package. However, I am currently drafting a paper as part of my PhD thesis, which will include a section dedicated to explaining the methodologies used in this package. The paper is planned for completion towards the end of this year, coinciding with the conclusion of my PhD program.
