Define new class class can defined new_class function. positional arguments specifying parent classes, BASE base object class provided package, don’t need manually specify . like advanced behaviour, can try implement object class. Class name mandatory unique. object environment containing useful attributes methods. OBJECT$..type.. gives current class name. OBJECT$..class.. gives current class name parent class names. OBJECT$..dir..() returns names attribute method object. OBJECT$..methods..() returns names method object OBJECT$..str..() returns string representation object, used S3 print() method. method usually needs overridden subclass give short summary object. 1.2. Register method class Methods can registered using register_method(). first argument object want bind function , rest positional arguments specifying method names functions. syntax method_name = function. can choose write inline function pass pre-defined function. associative environment function doesn’t matter, modified register_method() function. method needs access object , just simply use self method. reference object. 1.3. Override ..init..() method ..init..() method instance initialization. override ..init..() method, need use register_method() register . Now class requires two two arguments first_name employee_id initialize instance. 1.4. Build instance new initialize instance, need use instantiate() method. output show object. first_name employee_id stored object ..init..() method. 1.5. complete workflow recommend write class definition function make debugging easier. following example new class DEMO_2, defines ..init..() method, defines get_email() function retrieving email address, defines ..str..() method print object, provide us nicely formatted summary. use_method used run methods classes, case, ..str..() method BASE class.","code":"library(bandicoot) # You don't actually need to specify BASE here.
